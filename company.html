        <p>Founded in 2018 as Rubik.ai, we began with the realization that enterprise-wide data access has been siloed; data was simply not available to the people who needed it. Data engineers and database administrators have been the longstanding gatekeepers who funnel data to analysts and data scientists. We aim to change that by democratizing data access, enabling enterprises to make better data-driven decisions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>When all employees, irrespective of their technical skills or background, can easily explore and analyze enterprise data, then both productivity and market expansion are realized at a faster pace.</p>
        <p>Quickly, we discovered just how modern of an approach we were taking verses how other data companies were attempting to solve this problem. Therefore, we felt we needed a new company name to reflect that. Enter: The Modern Data Company.</p>
