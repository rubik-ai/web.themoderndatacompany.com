              <p>Today, enterprises and government agencies are spending heavily on a range of data products and stitching them together to get some semblance of a data fabric. These data products require significant integration and customization work; resulting in a final product that lacks flexibility and exposes multiple risk vectors.
                
                <p>We saw a need for a data platform that humanizes access to data, breaks data silos, and transforms companies as they step towards data democratization and gaining business insights in real-time...These are some of the reasons why we founded The Modern Data Company.</p>
              
                <p>The Modern Data Company is hiring a determined, ambitious and driven Customer Operations Engineer (COE) for our Government Team. The COE is responsible for two separate tasks. Pre-sales support and post-sale deployment.</p>
              
                <p>You will work with account executives to present solutions to prospects that address their use cases. You will learn about the use cases in collaboration with the account executive and coordinate with the product team to develop a presentation and demonstration that addresses the customer’s data challenges.</p>
              
                <p>After the sale, you will be deployed with the customer to deploy and train their teams so that they are comfortable using DataOS to solve their use cases in an expeditious manner. You will use your extensive data experience to solve these challenges and then work with the Technical Account Manager (TAM) to address other use cases within the customer’s ecosystem. Overall, you are responsible for the overall success of DataOS deployment for the customer.</p>
              
                <p>You will be working with the customer’s data operations and critical workflows. You’ll gain rare insights and contribute to some of the world’s largest and most important industries and organizations. You are a problem solver at heart and like to solve data problems to see results that really help customers.</p>
