          <p>Digital transformation requires trusted and timely data, but all too often governance policies meant to protect data end up blocking access for users who need it most. This prevents teams from moving or acting quickly, creates missed opportunities, and can even give rise to shadow IT. Any organization with an eye on leading their industry must have a data governance strategy that can accommodate access to trusted data in real time for all users who need it</p>
              
          <H3>This isn't impossible. In fact</H3>
              
          <p>Data governance often conjures up the idea of some central authority instituting a “culture of no,” but in reality it can be a powerful engine to scale the use and distribution of trusted data pipelines throughout the company. Data governance strategies should be able to meet the complex needs of modern companies. Data governance strategies should also enable organizations to develop and deliver trusted data to the right users in the right format and right time to harness business value. At the same time, with data governance in place, companies can confidently ensure data privacy, proactively complying with regulations, and allow easy collaboration with data professionals in every function.</p>
