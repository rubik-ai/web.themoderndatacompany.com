          <p>The Federal Data Strategy 2020 Action Plan outlines a broad agenda for federal agencies leveraging data as a strategic asset. Its overall goal is to fully utilize the value and insights from federal data for mission, service, and the public good by providing guidance to agencies when it comes to exercising ethical governance, conscious design, and a learning culture. The strategy outlines principles and practices that are focused on making data more actionable and sharable while assuring that only authorize users can access it.</p>
         
          <p>Fundamentally, this is a push for agencies to bring their data infrastructures up to speed. However, given the sheer growth of data and the decades of dispersal across a wide range of locations, many will find this to be a daunting task. While the private sector has produced innovative ways to manage data and data integration techniques that have given top performing companies an edge, the public sector still large relies on traditional techniques such as extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes.</p> 
          
          <p>ETL tools can be incredible effective for migrating big amounts of data to another repository, but their batch approach prevents real-time data delivery. Additionally, any time there is a change to the source repository, their scripts must be revised and re-deployed. ETL tools also cannot accommodate many modern data sources that are critical for AI development.</p> 
          
          <p>Rather than physically migrating big data to a new repository, data fabrics virtually weave disparate systems and data formats, providing seamless access to those who need it, whenever they need it. This makes data fabrics a proven and successful place for agencies to begin realizing the FDS goals.</p>
