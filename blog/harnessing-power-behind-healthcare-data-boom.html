            <p>The future of business lies in data, and any company ill-prepared for the ride risks getting left behind.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is true for nearly every sector, but it&rsquo;s especially concerning for companies in healthcare. Estimates suggest that a single patient generates up to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fict.2018.00030/full#B37" target="_blank" class="red-link">80 megabytes </a>yearly in imaging and electronic medical record (EMR) data &mdash; now multiply that by the approximate <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" class="red-link">7.9B people in the world</a>! And let&rsquo;s not forget the demands of tracking outbreaks, updating vaccine research, supporting the expansion of telemedicine, and the vast opportunities from wearables and smart health devices. </p>
            <p>All of this data is building up to an incredible transformation &mdash; from treatment to prevention, eliminating inadequate care, and surfacing fraud &mdash; and fueling a battle to leverage the world&rsquo;s health and wellness data. So why are healthcare companies so slow to jump into the ring? Healthcare data comes with several challenges including privacy compliance, its unstructured format, and various silos. </p>

            <p>This creates an urgent need for a data operating system.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>On the line: the benefits of a composable data infrastructure for healthcare&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>A single patient can generate a variety of data across multiple sources, creating a massive challenge for providers attempting to create a complete patient profile. For example, every clinic visit (each likely using a different EMR system), prescription, telehealth session, and health record from wearable devices creates new data points on separate databases. </p>
            <p>Connecting these different data points across their multiple databases can be extremely beneficial to improving patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Delivering personalized experiences</h3>
            <p>With a 360-degree view of each patient, care providers can better predict patient needs and personalize their experience with reminders and notifications. With the ability to pull in data from any source including smart devices and wearables, providers can also better understand their patients and improve their diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Accelerating and improving research</h3>
            <p>Connect past and present data from research and trials to enable faster analysis and better decision making. Have confidence in data driven decisions with quality, trustworthy data.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Ensuring data security and regulatory compliance</h3>
            <p>Allow the correct level of access to data for every team member who needs it, without risking patient privacy. Maintain compliance with privacy and industry regulations, including HIPAA and GDPR. </p>

            <h2>Solving the top data management challenges for healthcare organizations&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>There is an urgent and obvious need to rein in healthcare data, but there are also significant challenges the industry must overcome. </p>
            <p>Today, healthcare data can seemingly come from anywhere and everywhere in excess with increasing concerns around compliance and privacy. Even if it can all be cohesively integrated, the challenge of useability for a variety of users remains. </p>
            <p>This is where our unique approach comes in. DataOS, Modern Data&rsquo;s operating system, connects all data &mdash; no matter the veracity, volume, variety, or velocity &mdash; to enable life-changing results.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Follow along with us as we continue to explore data management in healthcare and other industries, and how DataOS lives up to the core tenets of Modern&rsquo;s mission.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
