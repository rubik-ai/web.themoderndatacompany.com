          <p>A couple of years ago we started working with a fortune 100 retail company in the US. They had invested 100’s of millions of dollars towards data management with no measurable ROI. Basic questions like “how many customers do I have?” were not answered accurately, marketing and personalization was being driven by low quality data that was a week old, frustrated marketing teams created their own shadow solutions to address their team’s needs.</p>
          
          <p>If this sounds familiar to you, you are not alone. 80% of data modernization initiatives failed to deliver positive ROI for companies which in some cases have invested over $500M to solve this problem. Data today is HARD. The biggest reason for this is complexity: </p>
          
          <ol>
          <li>Complexity in architecture</li>
            <li>Complexity created by data silos</li>
            <li> Complexity of existing data products
</li><li>Complexity of the organization</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>This is the result of years spent addressing symptoms of the data complexity instead of the disease. To quote the American anthropologist Joseph A. Painter, “…in the evolution of a society, continued investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy yields a declining marginal return”. This applies to data as well as it applies to society in general.</p>
          
          <h2>There has to be a better way.</h2>
          
          <p>We founded The Modern Data Company because we believe data doesn’t have to be this hard and done right, and can deliver immense value to organizations at a fraction of the current complexity and cost. </p>
          
          <p>Data is a 30% tech problem and 70% people problem. A successful data company can’t be built without immense empathy towards the customer and the people issues within customer organizations. TMDC is a value-driven company with empathy as a core attribute. These values are what will enable us to deliver consistent value and satisfied customers.</p>
